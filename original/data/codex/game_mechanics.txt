BEGIN gm_flux|Flux
Firing weapons or taking damage on shields raises the ship's flux level. If flux maxes out, the ship will be unable to fire its weapons, and taking more damage on the shields will {{rel:gm_overload|overload}} the ship. Flux dissipates continually at the ship's flux dissipation rate, and a ship can actively {{rel:gm_vent|vent}} flux to speed up the process.
TEST
- Testing a bulleted list with bullets and a {{color:h|highlight}}
- Second item in this list, testing the maximum length and proper wraparound, let's see if this works just gotta keep typing

***

And now for a bulleted list using a smaller font.
 
FONT small
_ Testing a bulleted list without bullets
_ And some more
- Does it work to mix in a bulleted item? You wouldn't want to
_ But let's see if it did

A paragraph with small font.

RESET

And the font should be back to normal.

Testing 100% in text and as a {{color:h|200%}} highlight.

BEGIN gm_flux_types|Hard and soft flux
RELATED gm_flux
Flux generated by taking damage on shields is {{color:h|hard flux}}, meaning that it can not dissipate while shields are up. Flux generated by firing weapons is {{color:h|soft flux}} and can dissipate while shields are up.

A ship that has enough flux dissipation can keep firing its weapons indefinitely, but if its shields are up and its taking damage, it will eventually build up enough hard flux to overload, unless it has a way to dissipate hard flux, or simply lowers its shields.

A ship's hard flux level is indicated by a small notch on its flux bar.
END

BEGIN gm_overload|Overloading
While a ship is overloaded, it's unable to fire weapons or use its shields or other defenses, but can still move normally. Flux dissipates at a reduced rate while the ship is overloaded.

Overloaded ships usually try to back off to safety, and are a common target for salvoes of finisher missiles such as Harpoons.
END

BEGIN gm_vent|Venting
While a ship is venting flux, it dissipates flux at twice the normal rate. The ship is unable to fire weapons or use its shields or other defenses, but can still move normally.

Venting makes a ship vulnerable, and ships will usually only vent while they are relatively safe, unless the situation is desperate. Heavily armored ships are often willing to take some armor damage while venting.

BEGIN gm_techs|Tech types
The tech levels of certain ships - {{Low Tech}}, {{Midline}}, and {{High Tech}} - are not a progression of quality. Rather, they are just different design approaches to combat, and one is not better than the others. More powerful ships usually have a higher deployment point cost.

COLOR Low Tech
==Low Tech==
RESET
Heavily armored, slow, using a mix of ballistic and missile weapons. Weaker shields. {{rel:codex_system_burndrive|Burn Drive}}, a common low-tech ship system, provides only forward mobility and allows the ships to chase down and punish faster enemies, but is not much help in pulling back from a bad situation. Larger ships are often vulnerable to being flanked and require support to be effective.

COLOR Midline
==Midline==
RESET
Generally average armor, shields, and mobility. Using a mix of ballistic, energy, and missile weapons. The energy weapons are mostly limited to beams - while the ships can mount other energy weapons, they usually lack the flux dissipation required to make good use of them. Often depend on specialized ships working together to maximize their effectiveness.

COLOR High Tech
==High Tech==
RESET
Fast, with strong shields and weaker armor. Using a mix of energy and missile weapons, with sufficient flux dissipation to support a wider range of energies. The energy weapons tend to have shorter range, which is compensated by the higher top speed of the ships. Often rely on hit and run tactics and in general thrive in a more chaotic battle environment.

All of these are generalizations, and exceptions exist.

BEGIN gm_damage_types|Damage types & hit strength
All damage types deal {{100%}} damage against hull, subject to the residual armor value. In addition:
IMAGE ui|icon_high_explosive
{{High Explosive}} damage deals {{200%}} vs armor, and {{50%}} vs shields. The shots tend to be yellow.
IMAGE ui|icon_kinetic
{{Kinetic}} damage deals {{200%}} vs shields, and {{50%}} vs armor. The shots tend to be white.
IMAGE ui|icon_energy
{{Energy}} damage deals {{100%}} vs both shields and armor. Weapons with a higher hit strength tend to be flux-inefficient.
IMAGE ui|icon_fragmentation
{{Fragmentation}} damage deals {{25%}} vs shields and armor. Weapons dealing this type of damage often have high DPS and flux efficiency. The shots tend to be red.
==Hit strength==
Weapons with a higher damage per hit deal more damage vs armor. The {{high explosive}} damage modifier is particularly helpful, but high-damage energy weapons can easily destroy armor as well. The hit strength of beam weapons is based on their DPS.
==Residual armor==
