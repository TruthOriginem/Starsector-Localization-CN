It's coming back to you now. Some minor report while in dock a ways back, you're not sure why you read so deeply into the neighboring vessels ownership status and history of public contract affiliations. Just something to pass the time while cargo is moved, perhaps.

You explain, referencing the details you now recall, that they are the $personName who is serving a long-term contract for the Provenance Supply Stock Combine, registered with the good ol' APCC- the Agreus Provisional Commerce Concordat.
