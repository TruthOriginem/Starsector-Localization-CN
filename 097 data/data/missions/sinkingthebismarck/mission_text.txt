Location: Somewhere between Druj and the Duzakh System fringe jump-point
Date: 193.03.14

Captain Gleise commands the HSS Bismar, Onslaught-class battleship, at the head of a task force sent to investigate what Hegemony SIGINT suspects is a Tri-Tachyon raider base on the otherwise barren world of Druj in the treacherous, radiation-swept Duzakh system. 

The intel about the base was, however, a plant by Tri-Tachyon agents designed to lead a much-needed Hegemony fleet, and Kane Gleise in particular, into a deadly trap.

The Tri-Tachyon profile on Kane Gleise describes a quiet man who led an equally quiet naval career which nearly ended when his escape pod was picked up by convoy-raiding mercenaries in the employ of Tri-Tachyon. Gleise was ransomed to the Tri-Tachyon Corporation then held for several years in a miserable prison-colony on the outskirts of the Hybrasil system. He was evaluated as mediocre enough a tactician to be handed back to the Hegemony in a prisoner exchange during one of the Second AI War's many ceasefire negotiations. But during his captivity it seems Gleise developed a cold hatred for the Tri-Tachyon Corporation; After his release, Gleise became forceful in demanding front-line combat assignments and his Hegemony psych profile began to contain worried notes, culminating in a somewhat gruesome incident after the capture of several high-ranking Tri-Tachyon executives. 

The event was classified by Hegemony intelligence. Gleise was promoted by the subsector's Space Marshal and given captainship of the HSS Bismar. It was thought that Gleise provided a certain selfless "lust for victory" that officers of the Hegemony could replicate. And so they did.

Unfortunately for Tri-Tachyon, Captain Gleise prevailed despite the advantage of surprise enjoyed by the Tri-Tachyon forces. The HSS Bismar sacrificed its escort to lock down and completely destroy two Tri-Tachyon cruisers before crippling a third in the final showdown.

However the Bismar's hyperdrive was damaged in the fighting and as it was limping toward the system's fringe jump-point under low power a Tri-Tachyon recon detachment escorting a supply ship stumbled upon Gleise's crippled battleship.

You command the TTS Chimera. It is now up to you to defeat the Butcher of Third Skathi before he can escape again.
