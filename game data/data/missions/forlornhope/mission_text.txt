At the turn of Cycle 194, the Tri-Tachyon corporation attempted a direct attack on the Hegemony industrial core world of Chicomoztoc. It is unclear to Hegemony command what exactly compelled this radical change of strategy but it must be connected to the unexpected voting out of CEO Artemisia Sun - seemingly at the height of success and personal power over the megacorporation - by a previously unknown fraction within the Tri-Tachyon directorate. 

The gambit to commit to a decisive battle was a shocking change from the hit and run tactics that Tri-Tach had employed to bleed the Hegemony white up until this point, but the Hegemony managed to hastily assemble a fleet of overwhelming massed firepower through the emergency commissioning of civilian ships, both on the official auxiliary lists and off.

Though the cost in tonnage and manpower was terrifying, the Hegemony Navy emerged victorious from the meatgrinder affair that was to be named the Second Battle of Chicomoztoc. Scores of veteran captains were lost, leaving huge gaps in the Hegemony officer corps. But in their final hours, new heroes of the Hegemony were tested and forged - from the previously disgraced Orcus Rao, to Ardis Soloman (who had not yet earned her infamy), to the son of Chicomoztoc and future space marshal himself, Baikal Daud.

To cover their retreat, Vice Fleet Director Kader - in command of the surviving Tri-Tachyon forces after the destruction of the flagship - ordered a rear-guard action by a single Paragon-class battleship, the TTS Invincible. She would later receive a harsh sentence from the review board for "avoidable loss of corporate assets". However it must be noted that her decision forestalled complete disaster and allowed the megacorporation to withdraw the remainder of the fleet to hyperspace, including the phase cruiser transporting the planet-killer device. Though the war was lost, enough Tri-Tachyon spacepower was saved that a conditional surrender could be negotiated in the Treaty of Crom Cruach which allowed the megacorporation to remain a power in the Sector.
