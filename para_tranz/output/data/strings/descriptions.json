The hull is rife with integrated automation, sub-AI cores, and maintenance drones using advanced military algorithms to multiply combat efficiency. Defensive armament typically consists of point defense turrets backed by long-range missiles intended to maintain pressure on hostiles in order to avoid a close-in fight.\n\nThe true power of an Astral lies in the unprecedented flexibility of its fighter complement. Nearly any enemy ship can quickly be dispatched by the coordinated launch of a wing of nimble interceptors, strike bombers, or support fighters. Automated facilities ensure that returning squadrons are quickly repaired, rearmed, and replaced behind the safety of the powerful X-35 shield emitter. The Astral carrier is never deployed alone because its light armor is vulnerable if the X-35 is forced down. The Astral, accompanied by a swarm of escorts, is best placed as the heart of a carrier task force which can subjugate entire planets and blockade enormous volumes of space.\n\nAmong the most technologically advanced capital ships operated in the contemporary Persean Sector, few Astral hulls serve in the Hegemony Navy due to the high technological requirements - and security concerns. Senior Corporate Officers of Tri-Tachyon and a few rare, extraordinarily wealthy private admirals sometimes make the Astral their flagship.",

The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.\n\nA relatively recent design, the Champion is a product of the historically recent \"Cruiser School\" naval revolution that never saw active service in the pre-collapse Domain Armada. Although prototypes were constructed and forge-ready specifications distributed to several battlegroups, the Champion was never cleared for active deployment due to an ongoing lawsuit between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards. Each megacorp accused the other of industrial espionage and inappropriately influencing the Armada officers overseeing the procurement process. The truth was more complex, inflaming longstanding rivalries in the officer corps as the investigatory committee called witness after witness. The Collapse prevented any sort of conclusive ruling from reaching the Persean Sector however, and now the entire matter is considered irrelevant.

Two barrels combined with a unique double-loader system form the core of the weapon system.\n\nThe Mark IX blueprints were first re-discovered in the Sector from a drifting derelict captured in the gravity well of Penelope's Star. After a hasty examination by an unqualified appraiser, the design was declared obsolete. The blueprint was auctioned off to a small mercenary organization known as the Free Star Combine, a militant subsidiary of the Ko Combine, and forgotten. \n\nCycles later, the Free Star Combine finally built a prototype and began weapon trials. The weapon was deemed too huge, difficult to mount in all but the largest craft, mediocre at best versus armored targets, and its range was anything but extraordinary. Nonetheless, the Mark IX stubbornly refused to be explained away by the theorists, as its raw damage output is impressive. These naysayers were quieted even further when secondary trials showed how utterly devastating the Mark IX is to shield generators.\n\nThe results of these trials did not remain secret for long, and the availability of the now common blueprints meant that the Mark IX was quickly manufactured to meet the demand in the Sector.",

A plasma cannon shell is a microfusion bomb which uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward.
