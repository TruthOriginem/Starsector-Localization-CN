The result was the 'flying landing strip' maligned by Domain officers as a command more fitting for a logistics bureaucrat than a fighting ship-captain. Complaints in the lower ranks were used by the old \"Capital School\" faction to send the Drover back to committee, citing insufficient firepower for the ship class to meet standard guidelines (which did not account for the strike potential of new classes of fighters). Set up to take a fall for massive overspend, the committee simply ordered the installation of four small missile hardpoints. This met the firepower requirements handily and allowed the Drover programme to proceed with only minor alteration.",

The trick is, of course, performing this maneuver safely by carefully juggling flux-load and positioning, though its service record demonstrates that nothing is particularly safe about the Grendel.  \n\nThe brainchild of an eccentric admiral who managed to capture procurement authority over an entire frontier sector, the first prototypes were installed with low-level AI core commanders. The AIs became rapidly unstable, even erratic, after only a handful of phase shifts. Subsequently, the precise details of these experiments were suppressed by an obscure intelligence ministry of the Domain and the project saved only by the admiral's personal intervention. With AI unsuitable, the next best disposable resource was tapped, and the Grendel saw its first combat service on the far fringes crewed almost entirely by Domain Armada penal battalions.",

Only a limited run of prototypes has been produced.\n\nGross causality violating technology was banned by the Domain, and this ban is now upheld by Hegemony doctrine - with Luddic support. Nonetheless, it is the handful of fringe-examples of this technology which form the foundation for interstellar human civilization from the old Gate system (depending on one's theory of its operation) to common FTL hyperspace travel and communication. Tri-Tachyon has always pushed the bleeding edge of these technologies - and of the law - by spearheading development of phase technology. The Scarab's uniquely hull-integrated prototype \"Temporal Shell\" system is no exception. \n\nSo it is not so much that the Scarab manipulates time as it avoids the normal rate of consequence of the local frame of reference. The effect, as upsetting to Luddic theologians as it is to laymen, is to seemingly slow time for the outside world. Of course one must avoid stating it thus in earshot of the applied temporal physicists who deal in such miracles to avoid a tedious correction of terminology. ",
