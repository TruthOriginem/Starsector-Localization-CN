==Scrolling lists==
The scrollbar becomes larger as your mouse gets near it to make it easier to click. You can also hold {{Shift}} while using the mousewheel to scroll faster.

 ==Input fields==
You can press {{Ctrl-Backspace}} to delete a word, and {{Shift-Backspace}} to clear the entire input field.

==Tags==
You can {{Ctrl-Click}} to select multiple tags, or to deselect one tag without affecting the rest of the selection.

==Intel==
You can press {{Ctrl-S}} to save the current set of tags, and {{Q}} to re-select them. You can also press {{Shift-Q}} to add the saved set of tags to your current selection. This only works for the tags on the {{Intel}} screen.

==Codex==
You can press {{F2}} anywhere to bring up the Codex. In many cases, such as in the refit screen, or when looking at a tooltip, the Codex will automatically open to the right entry.
