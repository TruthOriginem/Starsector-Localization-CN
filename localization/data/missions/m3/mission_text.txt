Location: Outskirts of the Selenius system\nDate: 207.11.24\n\nThe player has the option not to deploy and risk the Gemini at all, or use it to draw away some enemy.  The Gemini is fairly tough - about half as tough as the Hammerhead - and can take on a single Lasher by itself without much trouble.  The main danger to the player comes from the Condor's torpedo tube.  If the Broadsword wing is allowed to refit, it can be dangerous too - and can wipe out the player's shields with the heavy MG easily if they're not careful.  The Talons and Lashers are just fodder that make pretty explosions.
